      <h2>Hello there</h2>

        <strong>I'm Morrison Chantesha</strong><br /><br />

  <!-- ===== ABOUT ===== -->
  <section class="about" id="about">
    <h2>About me</h2>
    <h3>Words for pet lovers, by a pet lover.<br> <br></h3>
    <p>
      I’m a lifelong animal enthusiast and full time wordsmith.
      I cut my teeth volunteering at rescue shelters, where I learned how to
      soothe anxious pups, bottle-feed orphan kittens, and translate a thousand
      wags and whisker twitches into plain English. <br /><br />
      Over the past six years I’ve written: training columns for
      <em>Pawsitive Life</em>, product copy for eco-friendly toy brands, and
      long-form features on topics ranging from canine arthritis to the secret
      social lives of rabbits. My work blends journalistic research with
      first-hand experience, so readers feel both informed <em>and</em>
      understood. When I’m not at the keyboard, you’ll find me clicker-training
      my senior Lab, ghost-writing adoption profiles for the local shelter, or
      editing blog posts with a calico curled across my lap.

      <h3>How to Manage Pet Jealousy in a Multi-Pet Household</h3>
      <p>
        In homes with more than one pet, it can feel like a daily talent show. One dog insists on being first to the door, 
        the cat plants herself right on top of the laundry pile, and the parrot belts out songs whenever someone else gets attention.

      <h3>Keeping Your Pet’s Life Predictable During Your Next Trip</h3>
      <p>
        The suitcase comes out, and everything changes. For many pets, the signs of departure such as zippers, shoes by the door, 
        or a different tone of voice are enough to make them uneasy.

      <h3>Indoor Pet Activities That Burn Energy Without Draining Yours</h3>
      <p>
        Some pets start the day ready to go. A noisy toy in their mouth, pacing near the door, or full-speed hallway sprints. 
        These behaviors are common when dogs or cats don’t have a good way to release energy.
